## Milestone 1 feedback
Purpose, audience, & goal will work with the content you have here but it may also benefit with more detail. For example, identifying the types of businesses you want to work with would help define your scope of clients to a finer scale. Defining your audience will always benefit your approach when it comes to development. 

Persona lacks a bit of detail as well but it gets the point across of a general overview of the type of person you may attract with your goal. Everything you have here will suffice but as always, the more detail you can provide in the early phases of development will give you more of a solid path in what is ahead.

## Milestone 2 feedback

Your content strategy will work here. When it comes to the Contact section, your project will consist of a contact form as part of the requirements of the PWP project. The wireframe you have for the both layouts needs to be revised so it contains all parts of the website. This is includes the contact form as mentioned above. Revise the wireframe so that it shows the contact form and the layout of how it will look on both mobile and desktop.

If you need additional resourcers for the development aspects of your project, feel free to reach out to the instructors so that we may guide you in the direction of some functionality you may be seeking. Continue on moving forward with the development of your PWP. Keep up the good work!
