## Milestone 2 feedback

Your content strategy will work here. When it comes to the Contact section, your project will consist of a contact form as part of the requirements of the PWP project. The wireframe you have for the both layouts needs to be revised so it contains all parts of the website. This is includes the contact form as mentioned above. Revise the wireframe so that it shows the contact form and the layout of how it will look on both mobile and desktop.

If you need additional resourcers for the development aspects of your project, feel free to reach out to the instructors so that we may guide you in the direction of some functionality you may be seeking. Continue on moving forward with the development of your PWP. Keep up the good work!
